              HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a language of
              World Wide Web. It is a standard text formatting language which is
              used to create and display pages on the Web. It makes the text
              more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images,
              tables, links.

              <summary>What are Tags?</summary>
              <br />
              HTML tags are composed of three things: an opening tag, content
              and ending tag. Some tags are unclosed tags.<br />
              HTML documents contain two things:
              <ul>
                <li>content</li>
                <li>tags</li>
              </ul>
              When a web browser reads an HTML document, the browser reads it
              from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create
              HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have
              different properties. <br />
              Content is placed between tags to display data on the web page.

              <summary>How many types of heading does an HTML contain?</summary>
              <br />
              The HTML contains six types of headings which are defined with the
              &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;tags. Each type of heading tag displays
              different text size from another. So,&lt; h1&gt; is the largest
              heading tag and &lt;h6&gt; is the smallest one. For example:<br />
              &lt;h1&gt; Heading no. 1 &lt;/h1 &gt;<br />
              &lt;h2&gt; Heading no. 2 &lt;/h2 &gt;<br />
              &lt;h3&gt; Heading no. 3 &lt;/h3 &gt;<br />
              &lt;h4&gt; Heading no. 4 &lt;/h4 &gt;<br />
              &lt;h5&gt; Heading no. 5 &lt;/h5 &gt; <br />&lt; h6&gt; Heading
              no. 6 &lt;/h6 &gt;

              <summary>How to create a hyperlink in HTML?</summary>
              <br />
              The HTML provides an anchor tag to create a hyperlink that links
              one page to another page. These tags can appear in any of the
              following ways:
              <ul>
                <li>Unvisited link - It is displayed, underlined and blue.</li>
                <li>Visited link - It is displayed, underlined and purple.</li>
                <li>Active link - It is displayed, underlined and red.</li>
              </ul>

                What is the difference between HTML elements and tags?
              </summary>
              <br />
              HTML elements communicate to the browser to render text. When the
              elements are enclosed by brackets <>, they form HTML tags. Most of
              the time, tags come in a pair and surround content.

              <br />
              Semantic HTML is a coding style. It is the use of HTML markup to
              reinforce the semantics or meaning of the content. For example: In
              semantic HTML <b> </b> tag is not used for bold statement as well
              as <i> </i> tag is used for italic. Instead of these we use
              <strong></strong> and <em></em> tags

              <br />
              No, you can use hyperlinks on text and images both. The HTML
              anchor tag defines a hyperlink that links one page to another
              page. The "href" attribute is the most important attribute of the
              HTML anchor tag.
